# This is a full featured but generic sphinx environment. 
# It contains the sphinx extenions we have used thus far.
# However, there is a catch: Sphinx requires that you be
# able to import the environment you are documenting, and this means that the projects 
# dependencies must not break. For this reason, you may want to append the name of the project you are 
# documenting. For some larger projects we have done this and offer a sphinx_env.yml that comes
# pre-assembled.
