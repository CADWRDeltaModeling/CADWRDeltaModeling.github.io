                    <h2 id="Channels-Overview:">Overview:</h2><p>Channels are the fundamental objects of the DSM2 grid. The Channels table allows you to enter channel connectivity, parameters and geometry. Channels connectivity is defined by an upstream and downstream node numbers of the channels. Two child tables describe the locations and geometry of user-described cross-sections in the selected channel. Note that a default initial condition is required for every channel number in the DSM2 grid, and this is entered seperately in the Channel Initial Conditions table.</p><p><br/></p><h2 id="Channels-Tables:">Tables:</h2><ul class="table_list"><li><a href="#Channels-channel">CHANNEL</a></li><li><a href="#Channels-xsect">XSECT</a></li><li><a href="#Channels-xsect_layer">XSECT_LAYER</a></li></ul><p><br/></p><h3 class="table_name" id="Channels-channelCHANNEL"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="Channels-channel"></span>CHANNEL</h3><p>The CHANNEL table defines the connectivity, length, friction and dispersion characteristics of a channel.</p><h4 class="table_section_title" id="Channels-FieldDescriptions">Field Descriptions</h4><p>CHAN_NOChannel number.

DSM2 is commonly used with spatial resolution (delta x) of several thousand feet. You should only include features that are well resolved by this resolution, which means changes that persist over several miles. Even more importantly, you should avoid adjacent cross-sections with bottoms that vary greatly in elevation because they can cause odd behavior when cross-sections are interpolated to computation points. The bottoms layers of cross sections should represent the &quot;overall&quot; slope of the channel.</li></ul></div></div><p><br/><br/></p>
