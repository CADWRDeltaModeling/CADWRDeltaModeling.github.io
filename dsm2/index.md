# General Description

[DSM2](http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/deltamodeling/models/dsm2v6/dsm2.cfm) is a river, estuary, and land modeling system.

*   _River_ - Can simulate riverine systems, and has been extended from Sacramento to Shasta Dam. Also has been tested with high flow/stage simulations for flood modeling.
*   _Estuary_ - Completely flexible estuary model; stages and flows may be specified at boundary and internal points.
*   _Land_ - Includes effects from land-based processes, such as consumptive use and agricultural runoff.

DSM2 can calculate stages, flows, velocities; many mass transport processes, including salts, multiple non-conservative constituents, temperature, THM formation potential and individual particles.
