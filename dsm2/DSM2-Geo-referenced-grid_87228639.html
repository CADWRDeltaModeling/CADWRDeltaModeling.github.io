However the geographically referenced node locations or channel outlines are not directly needed for hydrodynamic calculations. </p><p>In addition to this the cross sections in DSM2 are based on bathymetry data that is used to generate elevation to cross-sectional property information. </p><p>Even though this information is not needed directly it is very important to keep the geographically referenced information in sync with the input parameters such as channel length and cross section locations in DSM2 input</p><p>There have been different areas for which the grid was developed over time, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the San Joaquin River Extension and the Aqueduct grid. The one that is most commonly referred to as DSM2 grid is the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta</p><h2 id="DSM2Georeferencedgrid-Sacramento-SanJoaquinDeltagrid">Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta grid</h2><p>The original DSM2 grid was based on hand calculated distances based on USGS Quad maps of the Delta (circa 1990). These were done on paper maps and the original information has been lost though.</p><p>A<a href="attachments/87228652/87228654.pdf" data-linked-resource-id="87228654" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="DSM2_Grid2.0.pdf" data-nice-type="PDF Document" data-linked-resource-content-type="application/pdf" data-linked-resource-container-id="87228652" data-linked-resource-container-version="1"> pdf version of this grid</a> based on presumably this information is often found in circulation. The grid map contained in this pdf was originally created using AutoCAD. However the node locations in this pdf version are clearly not in the stream at many times and certainly not geo-referenced to any projection system. Nodes and channels were not always placed very carefully, presumably because the map was primarily used to identify approximate locations of nodes, channels, and stations, and channel connectivity.</p><p>In the late 1990s or early 2000s, a paper copy of the grid was placed on a digitizing tablet, and nodes were digitized by clicking on each one (Amy Little might have done this). The result was a file containing approximate UTM coordinates of each node. This file was used by the DSM2 Cross-Section Development Program (CSDP) to create representations of DSM2 channels and cross-sections. </p><p><a href="http://msb-confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=15368194" rel="nofollow">CSDP </a>was developed by Brad Tom and Nicky Sandhu based upon specifications written by Ralph Finch in 1998 to derive the cross sections from bathymetry data, which at the time were mostly single beam soundings of depth that were available over many decades in the Delta. This tool is the basis of the current grid in 2000 and the recalibrated grid in 2009. As a by product of this effort the node locations and channel outlines were stored in UTM coordinates. Originally, these were not used directly to derive channel lengths, but they were used indirectly in determining the distance of a cross-section from the upstream node of a channel. The DSM2 GIS Reference project, which began in 2018, will used CSDP centerlines to determine channel lengths.</p><p><a href="http://msb-confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=15368194" rel="nofollow">CSDP </a>was developed pre ArcGIS and with ArcGIS now being fairly standards in DWR there is a need to provide this geographical information in ArcGIS format. In recent years, Jane Schafer-Kramer created an <a style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;" href="http://msb-confluence/download/attachments/12648674/Delta_Stations_with_DSM2_Grid.mpk?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1506539043973&amp;api=v2" rel="nofollow"><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="cfe6b033-9240-4c69-8f85-c60fefc194b7">ArcGIS version of this grid</span></a><span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="cfe6b033-9240-4c69-8f85-c60fefc194b7">.</span> Jane developed, under Ralph Finch's guidance, an ArcGIS referenced grid by manually putting nodes at the closest location based on the pdf version of the grid. Again the channel lengths from these would not match either CSDP or the original grid as it is an independent manual effort. Furthermore there would be a mismatch to the location of the cross-section positions. </p><p>In 2012, Tom Heinzer was contracted to develop an ArcGIS based extension to allow a user to develop cross-sections from DEM which in turn is based on interpolations of depth sounding data. This again is a work in progress and cannot import the current cross-sectional profiles available in CSDP.</p><p>In 2017, <a href="87228641.html">CSDP grid data for the 2009 calibration was imported into ArcGIS</a> and along with it the channel outlines and node locations. The channel outlines in ArcGIS were used to calculate lengths for the channels and these were then compared to the current grid.  There were many mismatches discovered and these should be addressed in future efforts</p><h2 id="DSM2Georeferencedgrid-2009Grid">2009 Grid</h2><p>The 2009 Grid is used for DSM2 v8.2. It is similar to the pdf gridmap, but it includes some upper sacramento river changes. </p><p>The node locations and the associated channel network lengths do have a match with the 2000 calibration files (spot checked). However, the 2009 CH2MHill <a href="87228715.html">mini calibration </a>adjusted node positions, channel lengths, and cross-sections for channels 412-418.  The changes made in these channels were incorporated into DSM2, and are included in DSM2 versions as recent as v8.2.0, which is the current release as of 10/2019. However, we did not get any CSDP or GIS data from CH2MHill.  Node locations were reverse engineered using the mini calibration lengths, starting with the common node position from channel 412. The overall sum of the length (reach 412-418) was unchanged and this assumption allows for a reasonable reverse engineering effort. </p><p>This reverse engineered effort is available on the shared drive as shapefiles <a rel="nofollow">\\cnrastore-bdo\Delta_Mod\Share\maps\csdp_2009_calib_converted\CSDP_Channels_Adjusted_MiniCalib.shp </a>(channels) and<a rel="nofollow"> \\cnrastore-bdo\Delta_Mod\Share\maps\csdp_2009_calib_converted\CSDP_Nodes_Adjusted_MiniCalib.shp. </a>The Nodes shapefile is missing some files, and cannot be loaded into ArcGIS. It was loaded into OpenJUMP, and exported to <a rel="nofollow">\\cnrastore-bdo\Delta_Mod\Share\maps\csdp_2009_calib_converted\CSDP_Nodes_Adjusted_MiniCalib_Recovered.shp</a>. These files are also available in \\nasbdo\Modeling_Data\DSM2_GIS_CSDP_gridmaps\GISGridmapV8.2.</p><p>These layers are the closest approximation to the grid used for DSM2 v8.2. </p><p>There is a large discrepancy in the channel length for channel 422 between cross channel and northern head of Georgiana slough. CSDP and ArcGIS calculations put it at 3300 feet while in DSM2 input files it is 5300 feet. This is not an isolated incidence, there are many others as documented in this <a href="attachments/87228641/87228640.xlsx" data-linked-resource-id="87228640" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="CSDP_vs_Channels_inp_Lengths.xlsx" data-nice-type="Excel Spreadsheet" data-linked-resource-content-type="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" data-linked-resource-container-id="87228641" data-linked-resource-container-version="1">CSDP_vs_Channels_inp_Lengths.xlsx</a></p><h2 id="DSM2Georeferencedgrid-DSM2v8.1andv8.2grid">DSM2 v8.1 and v8.2 grid</h2><p>For version 8.1 and 8.2, use this grid for referencing DSM2 elements approximately.

The shapefiles were created by exporting network and landmark data from the CSDP to WKT files and importing the results into QGIS, then saving to shapefiles.
